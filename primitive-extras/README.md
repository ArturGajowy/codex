primitive-unlift
================

[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/primitive-unlift.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/primitive-unlift)

This package provides the ability to lift arbitrary ReaderT transformed MonadPrim instances into `PrimBase` computations.

This is analogous to the functionality provided by `unliftio-core`, but generalized to `primitive`.
